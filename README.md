Git: git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, tracking changes, and managing project history efficiently.

GitHub: github is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, providing a collaborative space for hosting and reviewing code, managing projects, and integrating with other tools.
